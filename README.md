# ICTN6845-FinalProject

Project for ICTN6845 at ECU.

Project guidelines:
Develop a website for a hypotetical community volunteering service center where volunteers can sign up for the tasks listed on the web site. There will be one administrator account with priveledges to create volunteering tasks. Once created those tasks will be listed on the web site. Each task entry will provide the details of the task (time, location, how many people needed etc.). The volunteers can sign up for the individual tasks that they pick. They shoould be able to remove or modify their selections. The administrator should be able to see and control who signed up to the task teams.
